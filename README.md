# Lithology-prediction_machine-learning-
Lithology prediction from well log data using machine learning 

Applied supervised machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Extreme Gradient Boosting technique (XGBoost) for meticulously interpreting water bearing layers from geophysical logs. 
We have considered Gamma-ray, Density, and Resistivity logs from 25 boreholes drilled in Tawi Catchment, North-western India.
